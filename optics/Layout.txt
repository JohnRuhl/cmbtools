Intended organization of this code.

Questions to answer:
  - 1:  for gaussian feed, or square feed, what is aperture efficiency for 
	LAT, SAT?
  - 2:  for same feeds, what is the diffracted beam after circular stop?
  - 3:  What is far field of some pattern of panel gaps?
  

BeamFromAperture.py
   input: Aperture plane map, physical scale, wavelength
   FFT it to get kx,ky plane map
   Convert that to angular map
   output:  A dictionary with angular map, and scales for that.

BeamToScreen.py
   input screen, screensize, Beam_dict, distance
   Generate x,y arrays covering screen.
   Use beam_dict to make a 2D interpolating function,
    then interpolate that onto the screen.
   

ApEff.py
   input:  E-field at aperture, and aperture mask.  Same screen for both.
   integrate power over aperture, vs whole.
   output: aperture efficiency

BeamAfterStop.py
   input: beam at stop, and stop mask
   truncate beam with mask
   Call BeamFromAperture.py to get far field beam in angular coordinates
   output: angular map, and scales for that.

ApertureFunctions.py
 functions to return useful 2D patterns for E-field distributions or masks
  - gaussian(center, sigma)
  - circle(center, radius)
  - square(center,fullwidth)
  - horizontal slits ?
  - vertical slits ?
